		-- to initialize all local data - possibly depending on the given

		-- is fairly minimal these can be taken directly from the IRC RFC.
		
		-- One typical IRC message handler:
		privmsg = function(network, sender, channel, message)
			-- Do something with messageâ€¦
		end,

		
		-- There are two special non-standard handlers:
		disconnect = function(net, wanted, err)
			-- Is called when the network connection is closed.
			-- The parameter "wanted" indicates - if set to true that the network
			-- connection was closed by a module or the user and - probably - won't
			-- come back on-line.
		end,
		-- and
		connected = function(net)
			-- Fairly self-explanatory.
			-- Is - currently - called once the irc network sends an
			-- "End of MOTD" message - after which the connection can be regarded as
			-- established and the server should recognize every message sent to him.
