-Make auth module at least minimally secure
   (Introducing per-network authentication should solve the worst problems)

-Clean up the module interface
   (Constructor + Destructor + Handlers)

-Modules or components that handle IRC-related messages without being loaded
   with the user-interaction high-level modules.

-Unify Coding style
   (I pratically learned lua by writing Aurora :)
