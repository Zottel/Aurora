                 Aurora

I think this time I've found language and libraries that allow me to comfortably
write an irc bot I can stick to for a couple of years.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
 * lua 5.x with the following modules/libraries:
 * luasocket
 * copas
 * lrexlib-pcre
 * luajson (More or less optional, depending on what modules you want to use.)
 * lualogging


Installation:
  Huh? Create you config and run aurora.lua:
  
  # cp config.example.lua config.lua
  # lua aurora.lua

	When using luarocks you may want to call
	`lua --lluarocks.loader aurora.lua` instead to be able to use those.


Developer notes:
	When writing your own module, please have a look at modules/dummy.lua
	for the interface specification.


Troubleshooting:
  Problem:  "lua: attempt to yield across metamethod/C-call boundary" because
            copas tries to yield in its send routine. Most entertaining since
            restructuring the connection handling non-deterministically solved
            the problem until I connected to yet another network.
            
  Solution: This behaviour seems to originate from some high-throughput
            randomized (yay!) optimization in copas. I solved this by removing
            the following lines from the send() function in copas.lua:

            if (math.random(100) > 90) then
                _writing_log[client] = os.time()
                coroutine.yield(client, _writing)
            end
            
            I this will most certainly not affect Aurora, since irc throughput
            is limited on every irc server/network I know of, but I am not sure
            why the error occurs in the first place and the copas developers
            haven't responded to my bug report yet, so be careful.
