                 Aurora

I think this time I've found language and libraries that allow me to comfortably
write an irc bot I can stick to for a couple of years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
 * lua 5.x with the following modules/libraries:
 * luasockets
 * copas
 * lrexlib-pcre
 * luajson is required by some modules

Installation:
  Huh? Create you config and run aurora.lua:
  
  # cp config.example.lua config.lua
  # lua aurora.lua

	When using luarocks you may want to call `lua --lluarocks.loader aurora.lua`
	instead to be able to use the rocks.
